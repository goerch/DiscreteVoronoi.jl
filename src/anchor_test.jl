## In this file I am testing whether the choice of the centre of the rectangle
## can be improved upon by choosing a different "anchor" from which to calculate
## the closest site. The anchor will hopefully choose a more important closest site
## than the centre in some circumstances such as when sites are heavily skewed in
## one direction.

## Note: the anchor *must* (I think, proof by contradiction exists in my head)
## be inside/on the edge of the rectangle otherwise the anchor may choose a site
## that results in too large circles.
